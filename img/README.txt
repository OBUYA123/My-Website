Place your headshot image here so the site can load it.

Required filename for the current site: img/me.jpg

Steps to add the image:
1. Download the image you attached (or save it from your computer).
2. Save it into this folder with the exact name `me.jpg`.
   - Full path: `/workspaces/My-Website/img/me.jpg`
3. Open `index.html` in the editor and refresh the browser preview at http://localhost:8000 (or reopen the file) to see the image.

If you'd like, I can rename or move the image for you — upload the image file here in the editor and tell me to save it to this path, or grant permission and I will add it.
